# 4208-ASCII-Shmup
My first ever C++ project, a simple ASCII shmup written in pure C++ only, built on top of a provided ASCII renderer.

This project was my gateway into C++, and features a complete shmup game loop. Particles, collisions, different enemies with inheritence and a background are provided. There is a boss battle at the end, and a gameover.
